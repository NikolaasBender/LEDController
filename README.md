# LEDController
This is a project for an RGB LED controller on arduino. 
Feel free to use this code and wiring schematic for building your own 
rgb led controller with arduino.
This design can deal with a lot of LEDS. 
I have used these with the 16' led strips from amazon and a number of them strung together. 
I advise using a good power delivery system with either an external power brick or 
enough voltage regulation that everything is being powered correctly. This can be shrunk down and battery powered as well.
The potentiometer is the mode control so getting that connected is useful but not completely necessary. 
Be careful of the wiring as well just to make sure you don't put the power for the leds through the arduino. 

Have fun and feel free to ask questions.
